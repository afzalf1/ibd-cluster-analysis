# IBD Cluster Analysis

This repository contains R scripts for analyzing associations between patient clusters, diagnoses, complications, and surgeries in an IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) dataset. The analysis includes:

- Generating multi-way contingency tables.
- Calculating observed vs. expected ratios.
- Performing chi-square tests for independence.
- Computing adjusted residuals and FDR-corrected p-values for each cell.
